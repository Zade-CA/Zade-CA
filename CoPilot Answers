When a small business is acquired in Ontario, Canada, several employment-related issues can arise. Here are some of the top considerations:

1. **Continuity of Employment**: Employees of the acquired company may be concerned about the continuity of their employment. In the case of a share purchase, the employment relationship typically continues unchanged, as the company's legal status remains the same².

2. **Employment Standards Act (ESA) Compliance**: The ESA sets out minimum standards for most employees working in Ontario. During an acquisition, it's crucial to ensure that these standards are maintained, including proper notice of termination or severance pay if applicable³.

3. **Unionized Workplaces**: If the business is unionized, the Ontario Labour Relations Act, 1995, governs the relationship between trade unions, employers, and employees. The purchaser of the business becomes the "successor employer" and is bound by any collective agreement in place².

4. **Employee Severance and Benefits**: The acquiring company must consider the costs associated with assuming the employees from the acquired company, including salaries, severance, and benefits¹.

5. **Integration of Employees**: Decisions need to be made regarding which employees will be retained and how they will be integrated into the new business structure. This includes evaluating the value of these employees to the new business formed after the M&A¹.

6. **Legal Obligations**: Both statutory and contractual obligations must be considered. This includes understanding the rights of employees during mergers and acquisitions, which are found to be both statutory and contractual in nature¹.

7. **Due Diligence**: A thorough evaluation of potential employment issues is a critical part of the due diligence process. Hidden employment liabilities can significantly impact the financial viability of the transaction².

These issues require careful consideration and management to ensure a smooth transition and compliance with all legal requirements. It's often advisable to consult with legal professionals who specialize in labour and employment law to navigate these complexities.
